title: Who am I?
---

Hello! My name is Rayna Zhang! I am currently reading Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Six years ago, I came to the UK to start my A-level study. I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Economics at the University of Cambridge. I have long been interested in financial markets and wish to explore more via live deals. I wish to join a proactive team in investment banking.
