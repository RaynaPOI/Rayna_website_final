title: From Economics to Financial Analysis
---

I studied economics at the University of Cambridge, where I obtained a broad knowledge of economic models. Learning from microecnomics, macroeconomics to econometrics and industry, I enjoy applying economic theories into real business environment. However, I would like to be exposed to more practical application and techniques that are essential in investment banking. As a result, I chose to further my study at London Business School and undertake Financial Analysis. I am eager to learn more about corporate finance and financial statements.
