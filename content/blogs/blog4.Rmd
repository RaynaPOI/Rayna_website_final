# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

2. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

# initial data exploration
glimpse(weather)
skim(weather)

# select relevant data and transform to tidy format
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(c(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13, names_to="Month", values_to="Delta") 
tidyweather

```


## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

# transformation of dataframe
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(Date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         Month = month(Date, label=TRUE),
         Year = year(Date))

# create scatter ggplot 
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = Delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Increasing temperature in recent years",
    subtitle = "Weather anomalies on a monthly basis"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a separate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap}

# create ggplot using facet_wrap by month
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = Delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Month)+
  labs (
    title = "Consistent increase in temperature across all months",
    subtitle = "Yearly change in temperature by month"
  )

```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. N0ASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(Interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

# create density ggplot with filled according to interval variable
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=Delta, fill=Interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with transparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Recent interval emphazises trend of rising temperature changes",
    subtitle = "Density plot for monthly temperature anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year

  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(Delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Strong trend towards global warming within past 30 years",
    subtitle = "Average yearly temperature change",
    y     = "Average annual delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

# create 95% CI for the annual delta in temperature from 2011-present for each  
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Interval == "2011-present") %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_aad = mean(Delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_aad = sd(Delta),
            count = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_aad = sd(Delta)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_aad,
            aad_low = mean_aad - margin_of_error,
            aad_high = mean_aad + margin_of_error)

# print out CI in table format
formula_ci %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Year", "Mean delta", "SD delta", "Count", "T-Value", "SE", "Margin of error", "CI lower", "CI upper")) %>%
  kable_classic(c("hover"), html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  kable_styling()

```
```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula_update}

# create 95% CI for the annual delta in temperature from 2011-present 
formula_ci2 <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Interval == "2011-present") %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  na.omit() %>% 
  summarise(mean_aad = mean(Delta),
            sd_aad = sd(Delta),
            count = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_aad = sd_aad/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_aad,
            aad_low = mean_aad - margin_of_error,
            aad_high = mean_aad + margin_of_error)

# print out CI in table format
formula_ci2 %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Mean delta", "SD delta", "Count", "T-Value", "SE", "Margin of error", "CI lower", "CI upper")) %>%
  kable_classic(c("hover"), html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  kable_styling()

```

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
set.seed(1234)

boot_aad <- comparison %>%
  # Choose only  interval from 2011-present
  filter(Interval == "2011-present") %>%
  
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = Delta) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the mean of each sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")

# create and print bootstrapped CI
percentile_ci <- boot_aad %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci

# visualize bootstrapped CI 
visualize(boot_aad) + 
  shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci, fill = "khaki")+
  labs(title='Bootstrapped 95% CI (0.917 - 1.02) for the annual average delta in temperature',
       subtitle = 'Formula CI shown with dotted green lines',
         x = "Delta", 
         y = "Gross revenue (log10)")+
  theme_bw()

```

Generally, increasing temperature follows a similar trend through the year, however, there is a particularly higher impact in the first three months of the year. Furthermore, it is evident that 1981 onward, intervals have had wider bases, implying an increase in temperature anomalies. Upon an overall analysis of the above data it is evident that the average annual change in data is increasing at an accelartaing rate.
