title: My Internships
---

I have worked at CITIC, HSBC, Deloitte and Oriental Securities as a summer intern. 

This year, I was fortunate enough to join CITIC Investment Banking Division on one IPO project. I analysed and collected financial statements and accounting vouchers and drafted IPO Notification Materials for a company with revenue over 150M pounds. I was alo involved in inventory and fixed assets stock count in preparation for working papers. Although these work sounds redundant, I indeed have learned more than I expected.Additionally, I coordinated with CPA firms to conduct due diligence and facilitated auditing process including sales, expenses and payment.

My previous experience at HSBC gave me first insights into investment banking. I would say my internship at HSBC was a milestone in my career path. I was involved in 4 M&A projects, co-leading due diligence and bidding work streams and drove the corporate valuation analysis. I also helped with industry research and drafted a 30-page in-depth industry report covering current and future market situations, main competitors in the market and recent financial activities. For the first time, I built valuation models and conducted sensitivity scenario analysis to assess significant pricing factors and helped valuation increase by 10%. Last but not least, I conducted a research report on cross-border mergers and acquisitions of A-share listed companies to help IBD to strategise future business plan and investment strategy analysis.
